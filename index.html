                            <p>&lsquo;The magic thing about Rails is when I looked at it the <span class="key-point">first time, I knew how it worked</span> because I already knew Ruby really well.</p>

                            <p>I saw all the metaprogramming tricks; they were almost transparent, looking at it. But I didn't know you could put it together that way and create something so expressive and succinct.&rsquo;</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">What's Between You and Being an Expert Senior Engineer?</h2>

                        <p>
                            A lot of what separates 'just a developer' from 'senior developer' is independence &mdash; the ability to dive deeply into a technical problem and, with exploration, get to the right answer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A lot of technical problems in the Ruby and Rails world require going into, or through, framework code. Whether that framework is Ruby on Rails, Hanami, Sinatra or something else, it's important to be able to understand how frameworks and applications operate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Nothing teaches you about frameworks like writing a framework</span>. It's not any more magic than any other coding. It's experience and work. Specifically, it's experience and work in writing and debugging a framework.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, that experience can be difficult to get at work unless you've done it before. It's another "you can't do the work until you have the experience" catch-22's that you've seen before.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here's one way to break that deadlock: don't wait for work to tell you to build a framework. Just go build one. Rebuilding Rails can help.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Build <i>Your</i> Framework</h2>

                        <p>
                            With Rebuilding Rails you'll build a complete Ruby MVC framework from an empty directory.
                            Your framework will be structured like Rails, using the same architecture and the same
                            metaprogramming tricks. You'll <span class="key-point">learn the magic behind Rails</span>. You'll finish each
                            system and solidify your knowledge with structured exercises. And you'll get the gut-level understanding that
                            only a framework builder has.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="key-point">To be an expert, learn the fundamentals</span>. Then you can pick up not just Rails, but any framework
                            you want. Rebuilding Rails will show you the tricks and where to start reading the source code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When you've built these systems, <span class="key-point">you get a sort of X-ray vision into the framework</span>. You've had that before with code that you built for yourself. Wouldn't you like the same thing for Rails, Sinatra or your framework of choice?
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Future-Proof Mastery</h2>

                        <p>
                            At some point you understand basic coding, and it's time to take on more responsibility. At some point, you need to be ready to take responsibility for larger, uglier bugs and features. And so at some point, you need to master dealing with framework code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To master Rails, but also Rack and other Ruby frameworks, you need to work with the underlying concepts. That means <span class="key-point">knowing how an MVC framework is structured</span>. It also means metaprogramming. And you should <span class="key-point">know a few different approaches for how to build different components of that framework</span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            No book can fully prepare you. That takes practice. But Rebuilding Rails can start you on that practice and show you <b>how</b> to practice. Nobody understands frameworks like an engineer who has built a framework. That, dear reader, could be you.

                            Every chapter of Rebuilding Rails shows you how to build one system of a Rails-like MVC framework.
                            What are those systems?
                        </p>

                        <ul class="">
                            <li>Chapter One: the Gem, the Gemfile, the Framework</li>
                            <li>Chapter Two: Controllers</li>
                            <li>Chapter Three: Automatic Class and File Loading</li>

                        <p>
                            Every chapter teaches you more Ruby magic, which makes Rails more transparent. At 178 pages, the book will keep you busy for awhile. Each chapter convers the basic material and several exercises as well as pointers into the Ruby on Rails source code.

                <h2 class="mb-4">Why You Should Expense Rebuilding Rails</h2>
                <p>
                    You're a software developer. Your time is expensive. If you don't live in the USA, Rebuilding Rails still only costs several hours of your salary &mdash; in the United States, the plain ebook may cost around <a href="https://codefol.io/posts/fully-loaded-engineer-hours/" target="_blank">fifteen minutes of what the business actually pays to keep you</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If Rebuilding Rails makes you just two percent better at what you do in Rails and you stay with your current employer for just two more months, then RR has made a tidy profit for your employer. Each post-Rebuilding-Rails year you work there (say 50 weeks of work at 40 hours/week) with a two percent improvement will have saved 40 hours of your debugging time to be used on more interesting work, or made you 40 hours more effective at framework-related features. That's worth far more than the price of the book. <span class="key-point">By expensing Rebuilding Rails and reading it, you're doing your employer a huge favour</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To do them even more of a favour, you could pick up a site license (multiple book licenses) and share with your coworkers! I also <a href="https://codefol.io/workshops" target="_blank">teach workshops</a>, both in person and online.
