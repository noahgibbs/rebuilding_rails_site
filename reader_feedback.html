                            I just watched (and typed by hand) the Rebuilding Rails video chapters 1-6. What and awesome series! Iâ€™ve been a Ruby/Rails developer for 5+ years now, but I never bothered to understand how Rails works. I bought the book in October of 2019 and took a quick look at it, but never really read it in depth. After watching your video series, I want to know more about the internals of how Rails works. Iâ€™ll be reading the book, in depth, while typing out each example, starting this evening. Thanks for taking your time, which I know is valuable, since you have a family, to help us learn how Rails is built. Have a great day.

Intend on doing that again at some point soon. I came into the industry through the bootcamp route but I couldnâ€™t bear the superficiality of what I was learning and working on so recently Iâ€™ve been working through a bachelors CS curriculum and intend on starting a masters at some point next year depending on my preparedness.<br/><br/>

                            Just from following along and invariably having bugs.. you learn stuff, no matter how inexperienced.

                            I think that "Rebuilding Rails" is one of the most important books I have ever read. Most of junior/mid level engineers get stuck on some problem that they could easily overcome if they would treat their Rails and other gems codebases as their own and look at stack trace more carefully, play around with the code and understand how everything works on higher level. <br/><br/>

                            One thing that could be improved about this book is its cover and update the content to newer version of Rails. Updating the book is only important for junior/mid devs. I think that for more advanced developers this doesn't really matter that much.<br/><br/>

                            At various times, Rebuilding Rails has had:
                            <ul class="mt-3">
                                <li>A five-star rating on Gumroad</li>
                                <li>A 4.2-star rating on GoodReads</li>

                            Rebuilding Rails' material has been adapted into several workshops and conference talks, including:
                            <ul class="mt-3">
                                <li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/noahgibbs/build-your-own-framework-to-understand-rails-magic" target="_blank">A workshop</a> I've taught at RailsConf and Southeast Ruby</li>

                            </ul>

                            If you enjoy Rebuilding Rails, you have my permission to do the same. I'd love it (but I don't require it) if you'd tell me when you do!

                            Rebuilding Rails has been the basis of a number of talks, workshops and presentations by other people, including:
                            <ul class="mt-3">
                                <li>Recommended as a textbook for a <a href="https://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a> class taught by Ivan Storcke and Brook Riggio</li>
