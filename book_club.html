                <p>
                  Rebuilding Rails has been used for several book clubs and
                  similar "let's get together and work through it" series.
                  I have some recommendations if you're doing to do the same
                  thing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, decide if you're going to work through the ebook or
                  the videos. The videos are a quick, straightforward
                  "golden path" through the material. You'll get a usable
                  framework in as quick and simple a way as possible.
                  You'll also need to buy the full (more expensive) package
                  if you want all nine chapters.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The ebook is, by design, *not* the simplest way to get
                  a full framework. It wanders a bit. It makes you think.
                  It provides bonus exercises to let you choose how much or
                  how little to do. The code is slightly more complex, and
                  more similar to Rails. There are a lot of smaller bits
                  of advice and trivia that the videos don't have time for.
                  It will take more of your time and make you better. It's
                  also significantly cheaper to buy. The basic package
                  with no extra videos gets you the full ebook.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You should *not* have some people work through the ebook
                  and some through the videos. The chapters are very slightly
                  different and the code isn't compatible. Pick one or the
                  other, right at the beginning, and have everybody do the
                  same thing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you're doing this at a job, mention how to expense RR
                  to the book club folks. Gumroad provides receipts and invoices
                  that are usually just fine for expense reports.
                  You're improving at software
                  development. That's the kind of thing a company is usually
                  happy to pay for. Let them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you're doing this outside a job setting, contact me
                  for a group discount. If you're all working through the
                  book together, you'll all learn more. I <i><b>want</b></i>
                  people learning this, and I'm happy to give you a discount
                  to make that happen. Let me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For book clubs, video clubs, etc, there's a <i><b>fantastic</b></i>
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uRho69xSAI">presentation by Katherine Wu from RubyConf 2016</a>
                  on how to run them, especially at work. She condenses years
                  of mistakes into a nice short watchable talk. Highly
                  recommended before you start organising. Short version:
                  it's <i><b>really hard</b></i> to get busy people to reliably
                  show up to a book club. She tells you how to encourage them
                  to, how to make it easy for them, and so on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It's tempting to do multiple chapters per week of
                  Rebuilding Rails. That can be fine, especially for early
                  chapters, up to around chapter 4. But keep in mind that
                  the later chapters are a lot of work. Doing two at once
                  can be challenging, especially for the ebook version.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Nothing is perfect, and things change over time.
                  Rebuilding Rails may well have mistakes, or parts that
                  are out of date. Feel free to contact me, always, with
                  questions, comments and so on. I'm helping run an RR
                  book club at my job as I write this, and I promise,
                  I'm finding little things I want to fix <i><b>every session</b`></i>.
                  Feel free to contact me about anything. I'm thrilled when RR
                  helps people, and I'd love to improve the experience for
                  you if I can.
